If the album has multiple versions/editions (different tracklist, additional discs, different cover art or a catalog number), create new entries where appropriate and mention these in album descriptions OR in the external links.

Also append the album version the the album name if appropriate: "(Regular Edition)" or "(Kagamine Rin version)"

Also include the [multiple editions](http://vocadb.net/T/4877/multiple-editions) tag.
