Artist type specifies the most common role that the artist participates in, with some overrides.

- Music producer overrides cover artist if they have at least one composed/arranged song entry. 
- Verified artists can request changing the chosen artist type.

The available artist roles are limited and serve as approximations. 
    - For example, the person responsible for the song image should be credited with the "illustrator" role, even if it's technically something else (e.g., photographer).
