A remaster or remake ("修正版" or "リマスター版" in Japanese) is an improved version of a song. 

A remaster should differ from the original only in terms of mastering, though this term is interpreted loosely in the Vocaloid world. If the new version is significantly different, the remaster song type should not be used.
