New non-English title translations should not be added without a good reason.

For example, the song entry [ECHO](https://vocadb.net/S/68814) should not receive new **name/title** translations.

Acceptable exceptions:

- Translation is used somewhere elsewhere (add for improved searchability).
- Translation is related to the original name (additional context/value).
    For example, [マトリョシカ](https://vocadb.net/S/368) is from the Russian word "Матрёшка", but is also known by its Romanized form "Matryoshka".
