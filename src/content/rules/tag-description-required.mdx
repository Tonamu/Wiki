All tags should include a valid description.

A tag's description should explain its intended usage in clear English language. 

For normal tags, skip generic usage instructions such as "tag for albums/artist/songs...". 

- Use "Valid for" restrictions instead.

Include source links when quoting information from external sources (such as Wikipedia).
