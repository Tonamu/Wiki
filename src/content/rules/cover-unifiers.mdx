If the out-of-scope original version has 5 or more derived song entries (such as remixes or covers) on VocaDB, it can be created as a [cover unifier](https://vocadb.net/T/6751) song entry, unless it exists on UtaiteDB.

Cover unifier artists (out-of-scope) should be credited as "custom artists" (no entry). The [Temporary artist entry](https://vocadb.net/Ar/139625) can be used to bypass the creation form.
