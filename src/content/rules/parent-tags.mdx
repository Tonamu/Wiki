In most cases, child tags should **describe a subset** of the parent tag.

- There are cases where the subset relationship isn't as clear. Genre tags for example utilize the tag hierarchy for historical and stylistic origins.

- Additionally, fusion tags such as [folk metal](https://vocadb.net/T/1568/folk-metal) are neither subsets of [metal](https://vocadb.net/T/262/metal) or [folk music](https://vocadb.net/T/159/folk-song). 

For tags with multiple separate parent tag candidates, pick the one that makes the most sense.
