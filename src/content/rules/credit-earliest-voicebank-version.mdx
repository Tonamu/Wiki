If the specific voicebank is only partially credited, always credit the **earliest** voicebank. For example with "Gakupo Power", credit [V3 Camui Gackpo (Power)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1763) instead of [V4 Camui Gackpo (Power)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/34531 ). [unspecified voicebank version](https://vocadb.net/T/4862/unspecified-voicebank-version) tag should also be added.
