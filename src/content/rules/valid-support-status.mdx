Support status is for crediting artists who play a minor role compared to the main artists in the same role. It should only be used when there's a **clear separation** of main and support artists. If there is only one artist in a certain role, the support status should never be used.

Examples:

- Backing vocals, e.g., a background chorus when the main vocals are sung by another vocalist.
- Background illustrators (to distinguish them from the main illustrator).

Support status can't currently be specified to a specific artist role. For example, if a song composer is also responsible for the background image, the support status should not be used.

Effects of support status:

1) Support status removes the artist(s) from the artist string and affects the search through the ["Only main songs" filter](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Song&artistId[0]=175&artistParticipationStatus=OnlyMainAlbums).

2) Artists with support status never appear in the "artist string" of the song/album.

3) Support artists are shown in parentheses and after all other artists.
