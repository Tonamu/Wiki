A [remix](https://vocadb.net/T/371/remix) is a variant of an original recording, often in a different genre. 

Remixes may or may not involve recording new music, often using samples from the original.

[Self-remix](https://vocadb.net/T/392/self-remix) tag is for songs where the original artist remixed their own song.
