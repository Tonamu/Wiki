Song entries should include the earliest **public** publish date:

- Video streaming services such as NicoNicoDouga and YouTube.
- Distributing the song on a physical album at a record store or event.
- Digital album on a marketplace such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.. 

Private distribution does not count. Work in progress versions also do not count.

If the song is deleted and then reuploaded, the publish date does not change. It's still the date when the song was **first** made public.

If the field is empty, the publish date is automatically suggested based on the album and PV links.
