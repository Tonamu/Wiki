Always leave a source for the lyrics. If transcribed/translated by yourself, mention that instead.

If the lyric source is missing, locate it before modifying the lyrics. See [a list of websites where to look for lyrics](/docs/useful-related-informational-sites#song-lyrics). If the source can't be found, create an entry report for the missing source and use a credit like "Unknown (fixed by user2)".
