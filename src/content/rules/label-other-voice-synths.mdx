Engines for `Other voice synthesizer` (if available) need to be added as a tag and included in the voicebank entry name.

- If the voicebank has no separate engine, use the [voicebank-as-engine](https://vocadb.net/T/10630/voicebank-as-engine) tag. 
- If engine is not known, use the [unknown engine](https://vocadb.net/T/7036) tag. 
- Multiengine synths that have no clear or safe-to-assume base voicebanks usually have a corresponding "unknown" entry. These are grouped under the ["unspecified voicebank engine"](https://vocadb.net/T/9027/unspecified-voicebank-engine) tag.
