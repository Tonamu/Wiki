If artist entries include Youtube URLs, at least one non-handle version must be included.

- Handle URL: https://www.youtube.com/@YouTube
- Default URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/YouTube
- Custom URL: https://www.youtube.com/c/YouTube
- Legacy URL: https://www.youtube.com/user/YouTube

Adding links with different URL formats is encouraged because they can be useful for recognition and archival purposes
