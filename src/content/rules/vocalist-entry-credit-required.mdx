If the song includes in-scope vocals, and if the vocalist is uncredited, the artist entry [Unknown vocalist(s)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/23554) can be used. 

    - The entry [Unknown vocal synth(s)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/128519) or any of its derived artist entries can also be used to further narrow down the vocalist.
