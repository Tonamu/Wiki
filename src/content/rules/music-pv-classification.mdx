The [Music PV](https://vocadb.net/T/7378/music-pv) type is used for **remarkable** PVs of (usually original) songs, whether created by the original producer or someone else.

- Music PV = "Music video" (PV = Promotional Video)

Unofficial music PVs with only out-of-scope characters are allowed if the video has at least 100k views.

Remember to also credit the vocalists for Music PVs. Silent characters (that have no vocals in the PV) **should not be credited as artists**. Model tags (such as [CHAN x CO Miku](https://vocadb.net/T/1641/chan-x-co-miku)) can be used if applicable, regardless whether the character has vocals or not.
