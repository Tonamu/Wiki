Link categories are available for the main [entry types](/docs/entry-types) (songs, albums and artists).

- `Official` = Links to content that the artist can directly control.
- `Commercial` = *Official* links that include commercial features (such as album/song purchase).
- `Reference` = Unofficial reference, such as wiki article.
- `Other` = Other unofficial and useful links that do not directly reference the entry.
