Original PV is authorized content uploaded by a party with rights to both audio and video.

Usually, this is the artist themselves or someone uploading on their behalf. If this is the case, and it's not obvious how the upload was authorized, please clarify this in the edit notes.

Usually there is one original PV per service (Niconico, Youtube, ...).
