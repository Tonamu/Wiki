Voice synth songs that include both a voice synth version and a human-sung version (no entry) should be tagged with [simultaneous upload](https://vocadb.net/T/4946) if the publish dates are less than **a week** apart. 

- In this case the entry should be marked as `Original` song.

- Specify the human-sung version in the song description AND/OR in the external links with its publish date.
