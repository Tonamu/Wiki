Voice synth songs that include both an official voice synth version and an official human-sung version (out-of-scope) should be tagged with [simultaneous upload](https://vocadb.net/T/4946) if the publish dates are less than **a week** apart. 

- In this case the entry should be marked as `Original song`.

- Specify the human-sung version in the **song description** or **external links** with its **publish date**.

- If the human-sung version is published more than a week before the voice synth version, mark the song as "cover" with the self-cover tag instead.

- These rules do not apply if both songs have entries on VocaDB.
