If the voice is only credited by the character name and not further specified, the default choice in most cases should be the base voicebank. In some cases they are labeled with the text "unknown".

- Hatsune Miku = [Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1)
- Otomachi Una = [Otomachi Una (Unknown)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49701)

There are some exceptions where the base voicebank should be avoided. For example, **Japanese** "Xin Hua" songs should be credited with the V4 Japanese voicebank, since the base voicebank is Chinese.

- "Xin Hua" =  ["Xin Hua V4 Japanese (Unknown)"](https://vocadb.net/Ar/60459)
