**Direct** download links to media files (such as .mp3 or .flac) and links to file-hosting services (such as Google Drive or Dropbox) are not allowed, even if they're legal. If the content is officially distributed, link the artist's page (e.g., on Piapro or a blog) instead.

File sharing website links are only allowed if the website supports user profile pages, and the user (uploader) page is directly navigable from the download link page ([https://piapro.jp/](piapro) links for example). In other cases the download link location should be mentioned in the entry description instead.
