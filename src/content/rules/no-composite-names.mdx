Composite names consisting of parts that are pronounced the same way in different writing systems should generally be avoided.

Every field should contain only one version of the name:

- "Giga(ギガ)" is incorrect → should be separated into two names: Giga and ギガ.
- "Bumpyうるし(Urushi)" is incorrect → should be separated into two names: Bumpyうるし and BumpyUrushi.
