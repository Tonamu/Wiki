**Artist entries** for voicebanks created through any of the following methods are not allowed: 

1.     The use of unlicensed, leaked, or otherwise illicitly obtained development kits
2.     Generated from existing voices without explicit consent from the author or appropriate terms of use.

Song credits should be added with the “custom artist” feature along with the [unofficial voicebank/Jinriki](https://vocadb.net/T/7095/unofficial-voicebank) tag. It is possible to further specify the methods used by tagging the song with the relevant child of the [imported voicebank](https://vocadb.net/T/6363/imported-voicebank) tag or with the [VOCALOID V3 Developer Kit](https://vocadb.net/T/12114/vocaloid-v3-developer-kit) tag.

For example,  a voicebank made with the [VOCALOID V3 Developer Kit](https://vocadb.net/T/12114) would fall under the first case,  and most [RVC](https://vocadb.net/T/9730/rvc-ai) models (besides those that have consent) would fall under the second. Note that some voicebanks, for example, [Adachi Rei](https://vocadb.net/Ar/74389), have permissive licenses that freely allow for derivative creation, so consent is already granted.
