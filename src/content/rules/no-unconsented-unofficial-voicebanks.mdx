Artist entries for unofficial voicebanks, generated from existing singing voices **without consent** are **not** allowed. 

Song credits should be added with "custom artist" feature along with the [unofficial voicebank/Jinriki tag](https://vocadb.net/T/7095/unofficial-voicebank). 

Keep in mind that [RVC AI](https://vocadb.net/T/9730/rvc-ai) models generally fall under this category, unless the model is authorized.
