`Original` = Authorized content uploaded by a party with rights to both audio and video.
`Reprint` = A PV copied from another service and uploaded by a party unrelated to the original artist. Identical to the original upload.
`Other` = Subtitled PVs or Music PVs that can be considered low-effort. The audio lenght should match in any case.
