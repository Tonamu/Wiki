If a song-3 is derived from out-of-scope song-2, which in turn is derived from in-scope song-1, you can **specify the song-1 as the original version for song-3**. 

- The skipped version (song-2) should be mentioned in song-3's entry description. 
- The relevant tag [out-of-scope arrangement](https://vocadb.net/T/10594/out-of-scope-arrangement) should also be added.
