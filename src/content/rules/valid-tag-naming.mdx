When naming tags, use common English language rules for casing. 
- For example, Final Fantasy (proper noun) vs. progressive rock. 
- Abbreviations such as “RPG” should also be written in capital letters.

Many tags are language-neutral, meaning that they're not tied to any particular language. 
- Examples of such tags are genres (such as rock) and themes (such as summer). 
- For these tags, the non-English name should be translated to Japanese for practical reasons.

Unlike with other entry types, tag aliases do not need to be "real" aliases of the primary name. Tag that is used for multiple similar purposes can include multiple distinct "aliases":

[T/9493/teeth](https://vocadb.net/T/9493/teeth) includes:
- toothbrush
- toothpaste
- tooth fairy

This improves tag searchability and avoids "duplicate" tags that are conceptually very similar.
