Fan-made derivatives such as pitchbends and genderswaps such as [Hagane Miku](https://vocadb.net/T/7203/hagane-miku), **should not be added as artist entries**, as they are not voicebanks of their own. Corresponding tags should be used instead: https://vocadb.net/T/92/derivative.

- Official derivatives made or commissioned by the original creator of the voicebank, whether for Vocaloid or UTAU, are **allowed**.
