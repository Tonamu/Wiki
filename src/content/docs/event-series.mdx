Event series is an [entry type](/docs/other-guidelines/entry-types) for grouping related [event entries](/docs/secondary-entry-types/events) together.

Series name and event category are inherited to reduce duplicate information.

Event series entries can be created from: https://vocadb.net/Event/EditSeries
