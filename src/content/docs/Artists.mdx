Artist entries are pages for human artists (music producers, lyricists, animators, singers, ...), groups (such as circles and labels) and voicebanks.

Note that individual human artists may correspond to [multiple artist entries](/rules/separate-artist-personas).

These entries include artist-related metadata (as *fields*) such as names and external links and *connections* to other artist entries through two fields: *Associated artists* (for voicebanks) and *Groups and circles*.

Artists can be connected to song and album entries by editing the relevant song & album entries.

A full list of artist-related rules is available [here](/rules/artists)
