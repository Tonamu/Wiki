Song lists are an ordered collection of song entries. 

- **A custom note** can be added for each song in the list. 

- Song lists can also include **a song list name**, **song list description**, and a **song list picture**. 

- Song lists can also be [tagged](/docs/secondary-entry-types/tags).

A full list of song list related rules is available [here](/rules/songlists)

There are two kinds of song lists: 

## 1) Personal song lists

Personal song lists are editable only by the owner. 

They are displayed on the owner's profile page: https://vocadb.net/Profile/ username /lists.

## 2) Featured song lists

[Featured song lists](http://vocadb.net/SongList/Featured) are for song lists that are not based on subjective preferences.

Only [trusted users+](/docs/documentation/trusted-users) can create and edit featured song lists.

There are 4 categories of featured song lists:

### 1) Concert setlists

These can be attached to [event](/docs/secondary-entry-types/events) entries.

Generally the original version song entries should be preferred for the setlist, regardless of any [live recording entries](https://vocadb.net/T/240/live-recording). 

### 2) Vocaloid rankings

Various (autogenerated) rankings related to vocaloid / voice synth.

### 3) Pools (public song lists)

<RuleEmbed ruleId={167} fields={["id"]}/>

### 4) Other

Other song lists that do not belong to any other category.

## Creating song lists

Song lists can be created and edited in two ways: 

- 1) Add to custom list

The most convenient way is generally to use the "Add to custom list" -button on the song page.

- 2) Profile page

Song lists can be found by going to your profile page and choosing the "Custom lists" tab. On that tab you can also open a list for editing, where you can add a description or picture, or add/remove songs from the list.

## Song lists vs Tags

Pools can be used for largely the same purpose as tags, with some differences:

- Pools are not voted on, unlike tags. All pools are equal.
- Songs in a pool can be ordered.
- Only trusted users are able to edit pools. 
- Pools may contain only songs. Tags can be applied to albums, artists and other entry types as well.
- You can add notes to songs in a pool.

Always prefer using tags unless the songlist features are beneficial.
