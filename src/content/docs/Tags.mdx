[Tags](https://vocadb.net/Tag) are labels that can be added to all [entry types](/docs/other-guidelines/entry-types) (Artists, Albums, Songs, ...).

Tags can be edited more freely than other fields and some of them may even be considered [subjective](https://vocadb.net/T/3054). Therefore tags are **based on voting**. Tag votes are visible and removable to [trusted users](/docs/documentation/user-groups#trusted-user) and above. 

Tags are constructed by a hierarchy system: Tags are displayed as a [tree structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure), with the "parent" at the top and the children and siblings at the bottom.

An external program exists ([VocaDB-Tag-Graph](https://github.com/Shiroizu/VocaDB-Tag-Graph)) for visualizing the full tag graph.

A full list of tag-related rules is available [here](/rules/tags)

## Tag categories

<RuleEmbed ruleId={148} fields={["id"]}/>

Ideally:

- Tags in the same category share the same usage rules.
- Tags belong to only one clear category.

The available tag categories are listed below.

### Genres

Tags that represent a [musical genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre).

<RuleEmbed ruleId={171} fields={["id"]}/>

- [List of all genre tags](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Tag&categoryName=Genres&sort=UsageCount)

### Animation

Tags that describe the song's video. 

<RuleEmbed ruleId={152} fields={["id"]}/>

- [List of all animation tags](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Tag&categoryName=Animation&sort=UsageCount)

### Composition

### Copyrights

Tags related to any sort of intellectual property (IP).

- [List of all copyrights tags](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Tag&categoryName=copyrights&sort=UsageCount)

### Derivative 

Derivatives are (typically) fanmade (unofficial) voice synth voice configurations (derivatives).
[Akita Neru](https://vocadb.net/T/7204/akita-neru) is probably the most well-known of these.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={74} fields={["id"]}/>

- [List of all derivative tags](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Tag&categoryName=derivative&sort=UsageCount)

### Distribution

Tags related to how the song/album or content related to them is distributed.

Examples:

- [album-exclusive song](https://vocadb.net/T/9870/album-exclusive-song): Songs only released on albums, without official media uploads.
- [free](https://vocadb.net/T/160): Songs, albums, and voicebanks that have official, free downloads available. 
- [vocal data available](https://vocadb.net/T/6326/vocal-data-available): Songs where the vocal data is available for download.

Do not make tags for publishers, instead add them as artist entries under the Label type.

### Editor notes

- [List of all editor notes tags](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Tag&categoryName=Editor%20notes&sort=UsageCount)

Editor notes tags can generally be sorted into two categories:

1) Tags intended to be temporary, to be replaced if more information is found. Examples: 
- [possible duplicate](https://vocadb.net/T/344)
- [temporary cover art](https://vocadb.net/T/429)
- [tracklist incomplete](https://vocadb.net/T/432)

2) Tags that convey some sort of helpful information related to the entry that does not fit in other fields. Examples:
- [confirmed original bank](https://vocadb.net/T/9786) 
- [out of scope (cover unifier)](https://vocadb.net/T/6751)
- [special purpose artist](https://vocadb.net/T/2870)

### Event

Category for tags that better fit as tag entries instead of [event entries](/docs/secondary-entry-types/events).

- [List of all event tags](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Tag&categoryName=event&sort=UsageCount)

### Games

Tag category for video games that include pre-existing music in the game. 

- For example, [Senbonzakura](https://vocadb.net/S/8394) was published (on NND) before its inclusion in [Project Diva F](https://vocadb.net/T/358).

Games that do not include any pre-existing vocal synth songs in their soundtrack should be under the Copyrights category instead.

- [List of all games tags](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Tag&categoryName=games&sort=UsageCount)

### Instruments

Tags for tracking [musical instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument) used in songs.

- [List of all instruments tags](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Tag&categoryName=instruments&sort=UsageCount)

### Jobs

Tags to use as secondary artist types. For example, an artist entry tagged with [lyricist](https://vocadb.net/T/246) conveys that the artist collaborated in another song in the lyricist role.
