## Introduction

Tags are labels that can be added to all entry types (Artists, Albums, Songs, ...). Tags allow users to link entries together by any sensible properties they can come up with. Tags can be edited more freely than other fields and some of them may even be considered [subjective](https://vocadb.net/T/3054). Therefore tags are **based on voting**. Tag votes are visible and removable to [trusted users](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/documentation/user-groups#trusted-user) and above. 

Tags are constructed by a hierarchy system: Tags are displayed as a [tree structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure), with the "parent" at the top and the children and siblings at the bottom.

The list of tags that have mentioned somewhere on the wiki are listed at [mentioned tags](/docs/secondary-entry-types/mentioned-tags).

## Tagging entries

In most cases, child tags should **describe a subset** of the parent tag. Adding [Anime](https://vocadb.net/T/6611/anime) tag on an entry already tagged with [Sailor Moon](https://vocadb.net/T/6523/bishoujo-senshi-sailor-moon) is redundant. This doesn't impact the searchability, as the search can be performed with "Include child tags" filter.

- There are cases where the subset relationship isn't as clear. Genre tags for example utilize the tag hierarchy for historical and stylistic origins.

- Additionally, fusion tags such as [folk metal](https://vocadb.net/T/1568/folk-metal) are neither subsets of [metal](https://vocadb.net/T/262/metal) or [folk music](https://vocadb.net/T/159/folk-song). For tags with multiple separate parent tag candidates, pick the one that makes the most sense.

Tags shouldn't be used blindly - always read the tag description in unclear cases.

Generally, you should **avoid** tagging information that is **already provided by more specialized fields**. For example, tagging albums or songs with artist names is **redundant** because the artists list already handles this better. Likewise, tagging cover songs with "cover" is useless if the song type is already cover.

Adding tag votes to objective tags is redundant, unless there is a need to "highlight" the tag. By default, entry pages display four most voted tags before clicking "Show all".

## Creating and editing tags

Every tag should reflect some well-defined concept. For this reason, tag entries **must** have:
- A description (to clearly state the tag's purpose)
- A category 
- Usage on **at least one** entry (besides for tags of the "Copyright" category, whose [requirements are different](/docs/secondary-entry-types/tags#copyrights)).

Furthermore, tags applied to album or artist entries should be used on a sizable portion of the album/artist's songs. Additionally, do not add tags based solely on album art or an artist's profile picture.

Tags should add **new information** to the entry. Creating "derived tags" that replicate information from the existing fields is **discouraged**, unless the tag is useful enough (see the tag purposes below) and there is no easy/reliable way to search/list the relevant information ([duet](https://vocadb.net/T/3180) for example).

Generally tags should not be created or used for tracking **visual details**. This includes the creation of visual detail tags in the Vocalist category.

A tag's description should explain its intended usage in clear English language. For normal tags, skip generic usage instructions such as "tag for albums/artist/songs...". Use "Valid for" restrictions instead.

Including external links to objective sources, such as Wikipedia, is recommended.

### Naming tags

Use common English language rules for casing. For example, Final Fantasy (proper noun) vs. progressive rock. Abbreviations such as “RPG” should also be written in capital letters.

Many tags are language-neutral, meaning that they're not tied to any particular language. Examples of such tags are genres (such as rock) and themes (such as summer). For these tags, the non-English name should be translated to Japanese for practical reasons.

It is not required **(or recommended)** to add romanizations for the tags. Exceptions to this are tags such as [sakura](https://vocadb.net/T/54/cherry-blossom), that are simple, well-known, and more searchable with the romanization.

Unlike with other entry types, tag aliases do not need to be "real" aliases of the primary name. Tag that is used for multiple similar purposes can include multiple distinct "aliases":

[T/9493/teeth](https://vocadb.net/T/9493/teeth) includes:
- toothbrush
- toothpaste
- tooth fairy

This improves tag searchability and avoids "duplicate" tags that are conceptually very similar.

### Tag purposes

All tags should have at least one purpose:

- Discovery: Tag is used for discovering related entries (all genre tags for example).

- Search: Tag is used for searching or locating something already familiar ([animated PV](https://vocadb.net/T/3287) for example).

- Statistical: Tag is used for calculating different statistics ([western producer](https://vocadb.net/T/453) for example).

- Informatory: Tag is used to convey information that doesn't fit into the entry ([entry missing artists](https://vocadb.net/T/2808/entry-missing-artists) for example).

## Tag categories

VocaDB has specific tag categories listed and explained below.

They are the highest hierarchy in the tag system and every tag **must be attached** to one.

Ideally:
- Tags in the same category share the same usage rules.

- Tags belong to only one category.

### Genres

Tags that represent a [musical genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre).

* Obscure genre tags should be avoided. 
* Genre tags that are hard to tell apart and/or are inconsistently used by artists should be merged in most cases.

### Animation

Tags that describe the song's video. 

Again, **avoid** creating tags for tracking purely visual details.

Common exceptions:
- Tags for MMD-related ([ISAO](https://vocadb.net/T/4839/isao)-models)
- Tags for the general PV style ([comics PV](https://vocadb.net/T/3304/comics-pv))
- Tags for information/meta-details ([mismatching vocalist PV](https://vocadb.net/T/4879/mismatching-vocalist-pv))


### Composition
Tags related to the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition) of a song.

### Copyrights

Tags related to any sort of intellectual property (IP).

Copyright tags can be created for a few reasons:

* A) Official: IP utilizes voice synth music within the product (anime/game/etc).
* B) Official: IP utilizes voice synth music to promote the product.
* C) Unofficial: (Original) fansongs inspired by the IP ([Parody](https://vocadb.net/T/330) songs, [Image songs](https://vocadb.net/T/7989), etc).
* D) Unofficial: Derived (remix/cover) songs of official IP music.

Avoid creating tags for C and D if they do not apply to **at least 5** entries.


### Derivative 
Derivatives are (typically) fanmade (unofficial) voice synth voice configurations (derivatives).
[Akita Neru](https://vocadb.net/T/7204/akita-neru) is probably the most well-known of these.

By default, derivative characters (fanmade or official) **without their own voicebank** should be indicated with tags instead of artist entries.

### Distribution

Tags related to how the song/album or content related to them is distributed.

Do not make tags for publishers, instead add them as artist entries under the publisher type.

Examples:

[album-exclusive song](https://vocadb.net/T/9870/album-exclusive-song): Songs only released on albums, without official media uploads.
[free](https://vocadb.net/T/160): Songs, albums, and voicebanks that have official, free downloads available. 
[vocal data available](https://vocadb.net/T/6326/vocal-data-available): Songs where the vocal data is available for download.

### Editor notes

Editor notes tags can generally be sorted into two categories:
1. Tags intended to be temporary, to be replaced if more information is found. 

	Examples:
	- [possible duplicate](https://vocadb.net/T/344)
	- [temporary cover art](https://vocadb.net/T/429)
	- [tracklist incomplete](https://vocadb.net/T/432)
2. Tags that convey some sort of helpful information related to the entry that does not fit in other fields.

	Examples:
	- [confirmed original bank](https://vocadb.net/T/9786) 
	- [out of scope (cover unifier)](https://vocadb.net/T/6751)
	- [special purpose artist](https://vocadb.net/T/2870)

### Event

Tags that better fit as tag entries instead of event entries, and tags used to group events.

### Games

The category is for video games that include pre-existing music in the game. For example, [Senbonzakura](https://vocadb.net/S/8394) was published on Nico Nico Douga before its inclusion in [Project Diva F](https://vocadb.net/T/358)

Games that do not include any pre-existing vocal synth songs in their soundtrack should be under the Copyrights category instead.

### Instruments

Tags for tracking [musical instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument) used in songs.

### Jobs

Tags to use as secondary artist types. For example, an artist entry tagged with [lyricist](https://vocadb.net/T/246) conveys that the artist collaborated in another song in the lyricist role.

### Languages [Deprecated]

Use the relevant language fields instead.

### Lyrics

Tags related to a song's lyrics, such as [changed lyrics](https://vocadb.net/T/2866/changed-lyrics), [no lyrics](https://vocadb.net/T/310/no-lyrics), etc.

### Media

Album media types such as [Blu-ray](https://vocadb.net/T/42/blu-ray), [vinyl](https://vocadb.net/T/3375/vinyl), etc.

### Series

Tags are one way of representing song series.

[Song lists](/docs/secondary-entry-types/song-lists#Compared-to-tags) may also be used.

### Sources

Information about a song's origin, like it was produced in [FL Studio](https://vocadb.net/T/3257/fl-studio) or that it was an artist's [first work](https://vocadb.net/T/158).

### Subjective

Subjective theme tags, generally related to the emotional "feel" or "tone" of a song.

### Themes

Tags that convey the theme of the song/album.

### Vocalists

Tags that convey additional information about (synth) vocalists.

## Song lists vs Tags

Trusted users are able to create public songlists called pools. Pools can be used for largely the same purpose as tags, grouping songs together based on some common theme. There are a few differences between tags and songlists.

* Pools are listed on the featured songlists page.
* Pools are not voted on, unlike tags. All pools are equal.
* Only trusted users are able to edit pools. Any user can vote on tags. Thus tags are easier to use, but also more unreliable.
* Pools may contain only songs. Tags can be applied to albums and artists as well.
* Songs in a pool can be ordered. Songs with a specified tag are unordered.
* You can add notes to songs in a pool.
