We need help with adding and fixing the translations on [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/).

## Overview
Main parts of the [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) user interface are translatable. This guide is for you If you wish to help translating the interface into your language.

Available language options are:
* Chinese (Simplified)
* English
* Finnish
* German
* Japanese
* Korean
* Portuguese
* Russian
* Spanish

There are currently two methods to help with the translations:
Translating the text via "Crowdin" or directly through editing the resource files with GitHub. For the second method you need some technical expertise.

### 1. Translating through Crowdin

Crowdin is a localization management platform for companies and teams.

You can join VocaDB's translation project using [this invite link](https://crowdin.com/project/vocadb/invite?h=8d85a8e422a7f8a6ea089630935c7fd61702299).
There, you can easily search for missing translations or fix existing ones.

### 2. Editing the resource files

[VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) user interface is translated with [.resx resource files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ekyft91f(v=vs.100).aspx). Most of the resources are under these folders:
[Web\App_GlobalResources](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/tree/main/VocaDbWeb.Resources/App_GlobalResources), 
[Web\Resources](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/tree/main/VocaDbWeb.Resources/Resources) and 
[Model\Resources](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/tree/main/VocaDbModel/Resources) (including subfolders).

Note that you only need to care about the files ending with ".resx" and no other dots in the name. For example "AlbumCollectionStatusNames.resx", you **don't** need "AlbumCollectionStatusNames.fi.resx" or "AlbumCollectionStatusNames.Designer.cs".

To edit these files you'll need a resource file editor such as [ResX Resource Manager](https://github.com/tom-englert/ResXResourceManager/releases) or [Zeta resource editor](http://zetaresourceeditor.codeplex.com/).

Editing the files can be done in one of two possible ways.

#### Forking the repository on Github (preferred)

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [repository](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb) on [Github](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb).
* [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the [repository](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb) to your PC.
* Copy the original resource file and name it with the culture-specific suffix. 
    * For example, "AlbumCollectionStatusNames.resx" for German would be named "AlbumCollectionStatusNames.de.resx".
* Commit your changes and send a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the original [repository](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb).

#### Downloading the repository (if you're not comfortable with version control)

* Download the whole [repository](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/) as a .zip file from [Github](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb).
* Copy and rename the resource files as mentioned above, edit the copied files.
