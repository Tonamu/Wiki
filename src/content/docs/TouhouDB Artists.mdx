## Artists

### Required information to mark as "finished"

* Primary name
* Artist type (see below)
* At least one official link *if available*. If you're absolutely positive no official links are available, you may add reference links (MusicBrainz, VGMdb, etc.) or a short description, and tag with [limited artist information](https://touhoudb.com/T/1203). If you aren't sure whether more information is available, please leave the entry as a draft.

### Names

If the artist has a common name, you may add a disambiguation in the "aliases" section (eg. "[HIRO (黒板クリーナー)](https://touhoudb.com/Ar/9648)") to distinguish the artist from other artists with the same name.

### Artist types

* Music producer: Artists who regularly compose or arrange music. When multiple roles apply, this type takes preference over everything else.
* Vocalist: Artists who regularly provide vocals.
* Animation producer: Artists who animate or compile videos.
* Illustrator: Artists who create illustrations.
* Designer: Artists who contribute graphic design work, typically to albums.
* Circle: Units that publish albums, usually at events such as Comiket and Reitaisai.
* Label: Entities (often commercial) that publish albums for others but generally don't take part in song creation themselves.
* Other group: For all other groups of people who aren't circles or labels.
* Instrumentalist: Artists who are mainly credited for playing instruments.
* Lyricist: Artists who write lyrics.
* Other individual: For individuals who participate in other ways (staff members, photographers, DJs, etc.).

**Note: when multiple roles apply, use the most common role, except for music producer, which usually takes higher preference.**

There is also a special "Character" category for characters from the Touhou series. These entries act differently than other artist entries, and new character entries are generally only needed when a new game is released. **Please do not add entries for fan characters.**

### Artist pictures

Artist pictures are not required, but can be useful to make clear that an artist's entry is complete, or to easily distinguish artists with the same name. Artist logos or mascots are preferred, but other profile pictures may be used as well. Be careful when using photographs; only use photographs that the artist themself has made publicly available.
