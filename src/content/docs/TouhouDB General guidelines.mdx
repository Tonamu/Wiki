Since TouhouDB shares infrastructure with VocaDB, most of the policies and guidelines for VocaDB also apply to TouhouDB. However, since TouhouDB has some unique features, some unique guidelines are also necessary where applicable. If your question isn't answered below, please see the [VocaDB Wiki](https://wiki.vocadb.net/) or the TouhouDB [FAQ](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/touhoudb/touhoudb-editing-faq).

## General Rules

* Make sure that the content you’re about to add belongs to TouhouDB (see question one of the [FAQs](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/touhoudb/touhoudb-editing-faq)).

* Make sure to read the automatic infoboxes and edit warnings for potential edit mistakes.

* If an entry doesn't contain all required information, please save it as a "Draft". If an entry *does* contain all required information, please make sure to change the status to "Finished".

* Do NOT romanize or translate titles if you do not know the language well enough. **Machine translations are strictly forbidden.** It’s better to leave the field empty than have it incorrect.

* If you are romanizing a title, please check the [Romanization Guidelines](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/other-guidelines/romanization-guidelines) and [Romanization Walkthrough](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/other-guidelines/romanization-walkthrough) for examples.

* Entries created should look roughly similar to those created by trusted users.

* If you’re unsure about something, try searching the wiki or leave a comment or an edit note.
