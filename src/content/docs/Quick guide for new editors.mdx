- Make sure that the content you're about to add belongs to VocaDB:  [content policy](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy).

- Make sure to read the **automatic infoboxes** and **edit warnings** for potential edit mistakes. 

- Check the [rule reference](docs/pinned/rule-reference).

- **Do NOT romanize or translate titles if you do not know the language well enough. Machine translations are strictly forbidden**. It's better to leave the fields empty than have it incorrect. [Romanization Guidelines](/docs/other-guidelines/romanization-guidelines)

- Entries created should look roughly similar to those created by trusted users.

- If you're unsure about something, try searching the wiki or **leave a comment**.

- There is no need to make an entry report to delete an article you created yourself. You can delete it by editing it and pressing "Delete" at the top left of the page.

- You can remove tags you have added by simply clicking on the tag again. The tag's highlight will change from orange to blue, and will be removed from the entry once you click "Save".
