## Original Language

<RuleEmbed ruleId={24} />

The "Original language" is the language of the most common, official, primary name. This determines the displayed name when the user setting "preferred display language" is set to "Original".

This field is automatically set during entry creation but **doesn't automatically update** when the names are edited.

## Primary Name

The primary name of the entry includes the official or unofficial romanization and/or **English translation**. 

<RuleEmbed ruleId={26} />

**Do NOT** romanize or translate titles if you do not know the language well enough. **Machine translations are strictly forbidden**. It's better to leave the fields empty than to have them incorrect.

### Non-English

For original names in all languages that aren't English or Romanized, such as Japanese or Chinese.

### Romanized

For foreign original names written in the Latin (western) alphabet, usually Romaji.

- [Romanization guidelines](/docs/romanization-guidelines)

### English

For official names in English and known translations of foreign names.

## Aliases

Aliases are additional, commonly used names for an entry. Most of the time, they are not translations of the primary name, although well-known translations can be added as aliases. Aliases can be in any language.
