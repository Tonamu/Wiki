This page explains how to edit existing song entries.

The edit page also includes buttons for [deleting](/docs/content-removal-guidelines) and [merging](/docs/merging-entries) song entries.

The edit page is split into 4 different tabs:

1) [Basic info](/docs/song-entry-editing#tab-1-basic-info)
2) [Artists](/docs/song-entry-editing#tab-2-artists)
3) [Media](/docs/song-entry-editing#tab-3-media)
4) [Lyrics](/docs/song-entry-editing#tab-4-lyrics)

## Tab 1: Basic info

The basic info tab includes fields for names, description, song type, original version, duration, BPM, events, publish date, external links, language(s) and the entry status.

### Names

General instructions for entry names (= titles) and aliases are documented [here](/docs/entry-names-and-aliases).

Name rules that are specific to song entries:

<RuleEmbed ruleId={101} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={102} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={29} fields={["id"]}/>

### Song Description

The song description is for additional and useful information that doesn't fit into other fields.

[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is supported for formatting.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={23} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={104} fields={["id"]}/>

[Verified artists](/docs/artist-verification) can submit subjective comments using the [artist's personal description](/docs/song-entry-page#artists-personal-description).

If the original description is non-English, a separate English translation can be added in the field below.

### Song Type

Song type (`Original song`, `Remix`, `Cover`, ...) is the main categorization of the song entry.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={108} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={125} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={126} fields={["id"]}/>

Guidelines for classification:
- If **vocals are different** but the instrumental is identical, it's likely a **cover**.
- If the **song structure** or **genre** is different, it's likely a **remix**.
- If both the instrumental and vocals are changed, we mark it as a **remix**, because remixes take priority over covers.

#### Original song

<RuleEmbed ruleId={109} fields={["id"]}/>

#### Remaster

<RuleEmbed ruleId={116} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={117} fields={["id"]}/>

#### Remix

<RuleEmbed ruleId={112} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={102} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={114} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={113} fields={["id"]}/>

#### Cover

<RuleEmbed ruleId={115} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={127} fields={["id"]}/>

#### Instrumental

<RuleEmbed ruleId={157} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={111} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={110} fields={["id"]}/>

#### Mashup

<RuleEmbed ruleId={121} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={123} fields={["id"]}/>

#### Music PV

<RuleEmbed ruleId={118} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={119} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={120} fields={["id"]}/>

#### Drama PV

<RuleEmbed ruleId={159} fields={["id"]}/>

#### Other

<RuleEmbed ruleId={124} fields={["id"]}/>

### Original version

If the song type is not `Original song`, a separate field will pop up for specifying the `Original version`.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={105} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={106} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={130} fields={["id"]}/>

Original song can be searched/selected by:
- A) Song title
- B) VocaDB URL
- C) "id:\{song id\}".

The "Find originals" button attempts to find original songs based on the song title. The exact logic is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/blob/19012a3971bb96d103901bc7ffc4656b0ea10763/VocaDbWeb/Scripts/Stores/Song/SongEditStore.ts#L386).

<RuleEmbed ruleId={128} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={156} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={129} fields={["id"]}/>

Sometimes the entry tree structure grows unintuitive due to conflicting details. Correct entry tree structure can be formed with the following process:

Example: 10 related entries with various different song types by different artists.

- 1) Order the entries by **publish date**
- 2) Pick the first entry as the original
- 3) Pick the next entry and connect it to the current entry tree (by appending it)
- 4) Repeat steps 2-3 until all of the entries have been added to the entry tree

This means that the `original version` of any entry should not be modified later, assuming no mistakes or missing information. 

### Duration

Duration of the song. 

<RuleEmbed ruleId={131} fields={["id"]}/>

### BPM

The song [Tempo/BPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo) can be added as a specific number or as a range.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={103} fields={["id"]}/>

### Release Event

Release event(s) of the song, if available. For common [holidays](https://vocadb.net/T/6682/holiday) like Christmas, use the corresponding [tag](https://vocadb.net/T/64/christmas) instead.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={98} fields={["id"]}/>

### Publish Date

The earliest **public** publish date of the song (from any album/PV). 

If empty, the publish date is automatically suggested based on the album and PV links.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={100} fields={["id"]}/>

### External Links

Links to related content, for example, off-vocal/karaoke versions on Piapro. 

Links to lyrics should be added to the [Lyrics tab](/docs/song-entry-editing#tab-4-lyrics) instead.

Duplicating album and artist links in song entries is **redundant**.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={17} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={16} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={19} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={20} fields={["id"]}/>

<RuleEmbed ruleId={18} fields={["id"]}/>

- More on [External links](/docs/external-links)

### Language(s)

<RuleEmbed ruleId={107} fields={["id"]}/>

The language of the song vocals. 

Changing the language of the original lyrics updates this field as well.

### Status

Entry status communicates the level of completeness:

- **Draft**: Entry is missing crucial information. This status indicates that additional information is needed or corrections are requested.
- **Finished**: The entry has all the necessary information but hasn't been inspected by a trusted user yet.
- **Approved**: The entry has been inspected and approved by a trusted user. Approved entries can only be edited and tagged by trusted users and above.
- **Locked**: Locked entries can only be edited by moderators and above

## Tab 2: Artists

In this tab, you can add or remove artist entries that participated in the song.

Artists can also be added as **custom artists**, which adds an artist credit to the song entry as text without creating an artist entry.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={66} fields={["id", "entry_status"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={67} fields={["id", "entry_status"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={132} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={155} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={141} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={142} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={160} fields={["id"]}/>

### Support Status

<RuleEmbed ruleId={62} fields={["id"]}/>

### Artist Roles

Artist roles describe how different artists participated in creating the song.

The artist's type (from their entry) determines their default roles. For example, artists of the "lyricist" type are marked as the lyricist role by default. When the artist role differs from the artist type, the correct artist role must be specified.
