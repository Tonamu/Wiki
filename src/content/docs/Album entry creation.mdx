Album entries can be created from: https://vocadb.net/Album/Create

Before creating the album entry, make sure that the entry belongs to the database:

<RuleEmbed ruleId={47} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={48} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={49} fields={["id"]}/>

The album entry creation page requires:

- 1) An album name

<RuleEmbed ruleId={7} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={8} fields={["id"]}/>

<RuleEmbed ruleId={53} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={54} fields={["id"]}/>

- 2) At least one artist 

If the artist entry doesn't exist, you will need to [create the artist entry](/docs/artist-entry-creation) first.

After submitting the album entry, you can start adding more detailed information to it.
