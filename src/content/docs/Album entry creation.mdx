Album entry creation -page: https://vocadb.net/Album/Create

Make sure that the entry belongs to the database: [content policy for albums](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#albums).

Album entries can be created with:

- [Name](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing#tab-basic-info)
- At least one [Artist](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing#tab-artists)

These are **different** from the [finished album entry requirements](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing#finished-album-entry-requirements).

If the artist entry doesn't exist, you will need to use the ["Add an artist" page](https://vocadb.net/Artist/Create) to create an entry.

After submitting the album, you can add more detailed information to the entry on the [album edit page](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing).
