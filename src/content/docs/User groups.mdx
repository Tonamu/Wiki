## Regular user

New users start as regular users. 

Most of the features on the site are available for all users from the beginning:
users are able to edit most entries, rate songs and albums, post comments and more. 

## Trusted user

Once we have seen that a user knows and respects the basic rules on the site and that they're likely going to stay longer than a few days, we eventually promote them to trusted. You can read [this wiki page](/docs/documentation/trusted-users) for more about the trusted user status.

In addition to regular user features, trusted users have access to the following:
* [Deleting entries](/docs/other-guidelines/content-removal-guidelines) (not just the ones they created)
* [Merging entries](/docs/other-guidelines/merging-entries)
* Approving entries (and editing them)
* Removing tags from entries
* Creating and editing "[featured songlists](https://vocadb.net/SongList/Featured)"
* Managing [entry reports](/docs/pinned/entry-reports)
* Limiting user accounts (removing editing permissions)

## Moderator

Moderators are users who have proven to be especially reliable, being able to advise others as well as keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.

In addition to **trusted user features**, moderators have access to the following:
* Reverting entries
* Permanently deleting entries (moving to trash)
* Locking entries (and editing them)
* Managing tag mappings (NND tag -> VocaDB tag)
* Bulk-deleting PVs by uploader
* [Moderating comments](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/pinned/discussion-rules) (Editing and deleting)
* Accessing the manage menu
* Accessing the audit log
* Managing IP rules
* Flagging spammers and posting them to StopForumSpam
* Disabling/Banning user accounts
* Managing user account permissions
* Promoting user accounts (regular -> trusted)
* Handling DMCA, GDPR, user account deletions, other requests

Also see [management guidelines](/docs/other-guidelines/management-guidelines).

## Administrator

Administrator is the highest role in the VocaDB hierarchy. Along with having all the permissions of the groups below them, they are able to manage all users and access particular high-level settings. The number of administrators is intended to be kept very low because moderators already have essentially the same permissions.

For a staff list, visit [this page](/docs/footer/staff-roles).

## Limited user

Occasionally we have to reduce an account from regular to limited. Limited users have no editing permissions at all, and are only able to **log in** and **edit their profile**. This is intended to be only temporary and is usually the result of multiple ignored warnings.

## Special permissions and labels

### Email verification

Users with verified email can log in by using their email address instead of their username.

### Verified artists

[Verified artists](/docs/artists/artist-verification) are able to approve their assigned artist entry, which restricts editing. Additionally, they are also able to directly upload mp3 files to their song entries, which act like a PV.

### Staff

Label for administrators and moderators. Also displayed for users with the "Designated staff member" permission enabled.

### VocaDB veteran

[Automatically calculated](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/blob/dc352077711421e5d2c07a196aa427cc401b2841/VocaDbModel/Helpers/UserHelper.cs#L36-L44) label based on account age and activity. The most notable prerequisites are that you must have an account over 1 year old and over 1000 edits.

### VocaDB supporter

Users that have financially contributed to VocaDB, through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vocadb) for example.
