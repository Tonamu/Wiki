Song entries can be created from: https://vocadb.net/Song/Create

- Album tracklists (= multiple song entries) are easier to create from the album edit page instead. 

Before creating the song entry, make sure that the entry belongs to the database:

<RuleEmbed ruleId={10} />
<RuleEmbed ruleId={11} />
<RuleEmbed ruleId={12} />
<RuleEmbed ruleId={13} />
<RuleEmbed ruleId={14} />
<RuleEmbed ruleId={135} />

The song entry creation page requires:

- 1) A song title

<RuleEmbed ruleId={7} />
<RuleEmbed ruleId={101} />
<RuleEmbed ruleId={102} />

- 2) And at least one artist

If the artist entry doesn't exist, you will need to [create the artist entry](/docs/artist-entry-creation) first.

If the song entry shouldn't include any artist entries ([cover unifier entry](https://vocadb.net/T/6751/out-of-scope-cover-unifier) for example), the [Temporary artist entry](https://vocadb.net/Ar/139625) can be used to bypass the creation form.

After submitting the song entry, you can start adding more detailed information to it.
