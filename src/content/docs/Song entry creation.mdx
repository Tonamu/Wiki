Song entries can be created from: https://vocadb.net/Song/Create

- Album tracklists (= multiple song entries) are easier to create from the album edit page instead. 

Before creating the song entry, make sure that the entry belongs to the database:

<RuleEmbed ruleId={10} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={11} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={12} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={13} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={14} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={135} fields={["id"]}/>

The song entry creation page requires:

- A song title

<RuleEmbed ruleId={7} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={101} fields={["id"]}/>
<RuleEmbed ruleId={102} fields={["id"]}/>

... And at least one artist
  - If the artist entry doesn't exist, you will need to [create the artist entry](/docs/artists/artist-entry-creation) first.
  - If the song entry shouldn't include any artist entries ([cover unifier entry](https://vocadb.net/T/6751/out-of-scope-cover-unifier) for example), the [Temporary artist entry](https://vocadb.net/Ar/139625) can be used to bypass the creation form.

After submitting the song entry, you can start adding more detailed information to it.
