Song entry creation -page: https://vocadb.net/Song/Create

Make sure that the entry belongs to the database: [content policy for songs](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#songs).

Song entries can be created with:

- [Name](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#names)
  - The title section should only contain the name of the song. Vocalists, song type, producers, etc. should all be removed.
- 1 [Artist](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#tab-artists)
  - If the artist entry doesn't exist, you will need to use the ["Add an artist" page](https://vocadb.net/Artist/Create) to create an entry.

These are **different** from the [finished song entry requirements](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#finished-song-entry-requirements).

After submitting the song, you can add more detailed information to the entry on the [song edit page](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing). Some of the information is **automatically filled** based on the PV links (publish date for example).
