## Overview

TouhouDB is a free to use collaborative database for Touhou-inspired music, with artists, discographies, PVs, and more. Our goal is to be the most accurate and complete source of Touhou discography and artists.

Anyone is able to contribute and correct existing information by creating an account. Artists are encouraged to add their own information, thus providing a way to promote themselves. Entries may be tagged with specific [genres](https://touhoudb.com/Tag) and other meta-information. [Album release events](https://touhoudb.com/Event) such as [Reitaisai](https://touhoudb.com/Es/2/hakurei-jinja-reitaisai) may also be tracked. The site is designed to be comfortable to use by fans around the world, including both western and Japanese users.

TouhouDB is built on the same infrastructure as [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/), and makes use of the same key features, such as integration with streaming platforms, open source code, an accessible API, and more. A full list of features can be found [here](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/vocadb-what-is-it-for).

## Motivation

Other sites that focus on Touhou fanworks aren't necessarily made with music in mind, and may lack features such as a robust genre-tagging system and a way to keep track of one's collection. Other music databases may have these features, but aren't tailored for Touhou music, which has its own conventions and complexities. TouhouDB aims to be the best of both worlds in providing comprehensive information on Touhou music.

## What is allowed?

The three main kinds of music allowed on TouhouDB are:
* Arrangements of music from the Touhou series, and other works by [ZUN](https://touhoudb.com/Ar/1);
* Compositions and arrangements [in the style of Touhou](https://touhoudb.com/T/338); and
* Soundtracks for Touhou fanworks.

## How can I contribute?
