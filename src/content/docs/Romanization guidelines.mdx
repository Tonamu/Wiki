This guide assumes the reader has basic knowledge of Japanese grammar to be able to correctly romanize. 

See also the wiki page for [Romanization walkthrough](/docs/romanization-walkthrough).

## Title romanization rules

Follow these romanization guidelines when romanizing titles.

For Japanese, the rules are based on the [Hepburn system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) with some exceptions.

For Chinese, use the [Pinyin system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).

If you are unsure about the romanization, leave a comment on the entry. You can use @(username) to notify the editor who added the romanization.

Voice synth-related Japanese slang and terminology is collected in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h7KGUnq8WUJ87L7IgPxaTMvhNZ7npeSoseOJZmh8PoM/).

## What if I want to romanize song lyrics for VocaDB?

First of all, thank you for your help! 

Most of the above guidelines need not apply for lyric romanizations, but we request that you do follow the guideline of not using macrons for long vowels. Otherwise, it is up to your discretion.

Many older songs (and some newer songs) do not provide lyrics in their descriptions or elsewhere, and their lyrics can only be found in the PV itself. A decent amount of other songs do not have lyrics in the PV either, and therefore their lyrics have to be transcribed by hearing. 

### Visual Transcription

Visual transcriptions are almost always easier than auditory ones, as you can rely on both seeing the characters themselves and having the readings to go with them from the song's audio. 

- If you transcribe from a PV, make sure to link the PV as the source and add (Transcribed from PV) next to it. For example, "YouTube (Transcribed from PV)"
- The use of [OCR (Optical Character Recognition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition), such as Google Lens and other AI-assisted tools, is allowed, but they should not be blindly trusted. If you use them, make sure to confirm that they are accurate before adding them to an entry. Keep in mind that OCR is often quite unreliable on stylized or low-quality text.

### Audio Transcription

Audio transcription is much more difficult than visual transcription, duing to the wide variety of characters that share similar or identical readings. Transcribers need to not only know these characters, but also decide which one fits the given context best. For this reason, it is generally discouraged to attempt audio transcriptions unless you are advanced enough in the languge.
