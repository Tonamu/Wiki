For Japanese, use the rules of modified [Hepburn romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) unless an exception has been indicated below.

For Chinese, use the [Pinyin system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).

- Applies to: All entries

### Rule: Romanization, Japanese whitespace

Separate all words and particles with spaces. 

### Rule: Romanization, Chinese whitespace

For Chinese romaji, separate each character with a space.

Special names and proper nouns are kept together.

### Rule: Romanization, capitalization

Capitalize all words that are NOT single kana particles （は、が、を、etc）.

- E.g. *歌に形はないけれど* would be romanized as 'Uta ni Katachi wa Nai Keredo'.

### Rule: Romanization, no macrons for long vowels

Do not use macrons for long vowels. 

- *こおり* is romanized as 'koori', not 'kōri'.

### Rule: Romanization, apostrophe after ん

If ん is followed by a vowel (including や・ゆ・よ), romanize it as n'.
 
- E.g. *してやんよ* would be romanized as "Shiteyan'yo'"

### Rule: Romanization, は

は (ha) is romanized as 'wa' if it is used after a noun as a topic marker. 

- E.g. *恋は戦争* would be romanized as 'Koi wa Sensou', the は is not part of a word and functions as a particle.

### Rule: Romanization, づ

づ is romanized as 'dzu'.

### Rule: Romanization, を 

を (wo) is romanized as 'o' if it is used after a noun as a direct object particle. 

- E.g. *地球最後の告白を* would be romanized as 'Chikyuu Saigo no Kokuhaku o'

### Rule: Romanization, へ

へ (he) is romanized as 'e' if it is used after the name of a place to indicate direction as a particle. 

- E.g. *駆ける、星空の彼方へ* would be romanized as 'Kakeru, Hoshizora no Kanata e', the へ is not part of a word and functions as a particle.

### Rule: Romanization, identical name order

Use the same order as the original Japanese name. 

Usually this is "Lastname Firstname".

### Rule: Romanization, loanwords

Loanwords are romanized into their original language. 

- *コーヒー* would be romanized as 'coffee'. 

### Rule: Romanization, honorific suffix dash

Use a dash with honorific suffixes on names. 

- *お姉さん* would be romanized as 'Onee-san'

### Rule: Romanization, fully loanword names

If the entire name is composed of loanwords, leave the romanized name field empty. Use the translated name field instead.

## No AI-assisted audio transcriptions

Ai-assisted tools are not allowed for audio transcription, as they are extremely inaccurate with languages like Japanese and Chinese and even more so with Vocaloid.
