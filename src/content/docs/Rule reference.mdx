Verified artists can request unlinking from the circle/group in any case.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Artist` entries

## Rule: Label other voice synths

Engines for `Other voice synthesizer` (if available) need to be added as a tag and included in the voicebank entry name.

- If engine is not known, use the [unknown engine -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/7036). 
- Multiengine synths that have no clear or safe-to-assume base voicebanks usually have a corresponding "unknown"-entry. These are grouped under the ["unspecified voicebank engine"](https://vocadb.net/T/9027/unspecified-voicebank-engine) -tag.

The original song is the version of the song that was published first. Later versions are considered derivatives **regardless of who made them**.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: instrumental-tag

Original songs without vocals require the instrumental-tag

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

A remix is a variant of an original recording, often in a different genre. 

`Remix` = Different instrumentals. 

[Self-remix](https://vocadb.net/T/392/self-remix) tag is for songs where the original artist remixed their own song.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

A Cover (カバー曲) is a re-recorded version of a song, usually by a different artist. In the voice synth world, covers often use a different voicebank while keeping the instrumentals intact.

`Cover` = Different vocals.

[Self-cover](https://vocadb.net/T/391) tag is for songs where the original artist covered their own song.

Songs with (only) [changed lyrics](https://vocadb.net/T/2866) or [added lyrics](https://vocadb.net/T/8892) should be marked as covers.

Note that entries with the [out of scope arrangement](https://vocadb.net/T/10594/) -tag sound instrumentally different from the base entry.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Remaster classification

A remaster or remake ("修正版" or "リマスター版" in Japanese) is an improved version of a song. 

A remaster should differ from the original only in terms of mastering, though this term is interpreted loosely in the Vocaloid world. If the new version is significantly different, the remaster song type should not be used.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Remaster entry reuse

If the original is replaced by the remaster, it's unnecessary to create a separate entry for the original if the original audio is unavailable and the remaster is uploaded within a month. The remaster can use the "original song" type.

- Applies to: All `Song` entries

## Rule: Music PV classification

Terminology:
- Music PV = "Music video" (PV = Promotional Video)

The `music PV` type is used for **remarkable** PVs of (usually original) songs, whether created by the original producer or someone else.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Music PV entry reuse

If the remarkable official music PV has the same length as the original entry AND if the original entry has no official upload (album track for example), reuse the original entry.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Low-effort Music PVs

New Music PV -entries should not be created for unofficial low-effort PVs. These can be added as `Other` PVs to the original entry instead, if the song length matches.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Mashup classification

Mashups are songs made by blending two or more songs together. 

Songs that mix multiple covers of the same song together (joining multiple vocal tracks) should be labeled as covers.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Specify mashup sources

Specify all the original versions in the song description.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Medley classification

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Other song type classification

The `Other` song type is for album tracks that do not belong to any other song type.

- For example, [Commentary](https://vocadb.net/T/422/commentary).

## Rule: Song type priority

Remix/Remaster > Cover > Music PV

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

VocaDB song type classifications should be prioritized over official labels.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Simultaneous uploads

Voice synth songs that include both a voice synth version and a human-sung version (no entry) should be tagged with [simultaneous upload](https://vocadb.net/T/4946) if the publish dates are less than **a week** apart. 

- In this case the entry should be marked as `Original` song.

- Specify the human-sung version in the song description AND/OR in the external links with its publish date.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: First published as original

Original version should be the entry with the earliest publish date.

If multiple versions of a song are uploaded simultaneously, it doesn't generally matter which is picked as the original version.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Most relevant original version

If multiple original versions apply, choose the most relevant entry and mention the rest in the entry description.

Entry tree structure should be immutable and sorted by publish dates.

- Applies to: All `Song` entries

## Rule: Cover unifiers

If the out-of-scope original song has 5 or more derived song entries (remix or cover) on VocaDB, it can be created as a [cover unifier](https://vocadb.net/T/6751) entry, unless it exists on UtaiteDB.

- Applies to: All `Song` entries

## Rule: Same audio

All PVs in the song entry should have the same audio and roughly the same song length.

[Unrelated intros](https://vocadb.net/T/6334) and [outros](https://vocadb.net/T/6494/unrelated-outro) are an exception to this.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Skip original artist credits for derived songs

If the original artist is not directly involved with the derived version, the artist credit should not be duplicated from the original entry.

- External source: "From MikuWiki" -> "From MikuWiki (edited by user2)"

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: No significant lyric modifications

Large lyric edits require creating new lyrics.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Vocalist entry credit required

If the song includes in-scope vocals, and if the vocalist is uncredited, the artist entry [Unknown vocalist(s)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/23554) can be used. 

    - The entry [Unknown vocal synth(s)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/128519) or any of its derived artist entries can also be used to further narrow down the vocalist.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

- Relevant validation errors: `NonInstrumentalSongNeedsVocalists`

## Rule: Credit earliest voicebank version

If the specific voicebank is only partially credited, always credit the **earliest** voicebank. For example with "Gakupo Power", credit [V3 Camui Gackpo (Power)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1763) instead of [V4 Camui Gackpo (Power)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/34531 ). [unspecified voicebank version](https://vocadb.net/T/4862/unspecified-voicebank-version) tag should also be added.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entriesv

## Rule: Matching voicebank language

Song language should match one of the voicebank languages, unless the song is tagged with [unsupported language](https://vocadb.net/T/7059).

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Unconfirmed vocalists tag

When crediting a derived voicebank **based on hearing**, [Hatsune Miku Append (Soft)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/78) for example, tag the entry with ["unconfirmed vocalists"](https://vocadb.net/T/6416) or document the source in the edit notes.

- Applies to: All `Song` entries

## Rule: Unspecified voicebank tag

When the vocalist sounds different from the base-version but no further guess exists, the [unspecified voicebank](https://vocadb.net/T/2982) -tag can be used.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Song` entries

## Rule: Tag usage requirements

Tags should be included in at least one entry.

Tags in the `Copyrights` category require 5 relevant entries.

Abstract grouping tags do not require any connected non-tag entries.

- Applies to: All `Tag` entries

## Rule: Tag category required

All tags should specify the tag cateogry.

- Applies to: All `Tag` entries

## Rule: Tag purpose

All tags should have at least one valid [purpose](/docs/secondary-entry-types/tags#tag-purposes).

- Applies to: All `Tag` entries

## Rule: Tag description required

All tags should include a valid description.

- Applies to: All `Tag` entries

## Rule: No tag romanizations

It is not required (or recommended) to add romanizations for the tags.

Exceptions to this are tags such as [sakura](https://vocadb.net/T/54/cherry-blossom), that are simple, well-known, and more searchable with the added romanization.

- Applies to: All `Tag` entries

## Rule: No visual tags

Generally tags should not be created or used for tracking visual details.

- Applies to: All `Tag` entries

## Rule: Parent tags

In most cases, child tags should **describe a subset** of the parent tag.

- There are cases where the subset relationship isn't as clear. Genre tags for example utilize the tag hierarchy for historical and stylistic origins.

- Additionally, fusion tags such as [folk metal](https://vocadb.net/T/1568/folk-metal) are neither subsets of [metal](https://vocadb.net/T/262/metal) or [folk music](https://vocadb.net/T/159/folk-song). 

For tags with multiple separate parent tag candidates, pick the one that makes the most sense.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Tag` entries

## Rule: Related tags

Immediate parent/child tags should not be set as related tags.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Tag` entries
