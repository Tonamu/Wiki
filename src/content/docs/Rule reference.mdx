**Work in progress**

All the edit-related VocaDB rules are described here in an atomic and structured form.

A corresponding spreadsheet with additional details is currently hosted on [google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nl-n4_EoM8SggTDrKfr5-q6uQmwLHAsnKsM1fK4nzbs).

Numeric rule IDs will be included later.

For Japanese, use the rules of modified [Hepburn romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) unless an exception has been indicated below.

For Chinese, use the [Pinyin system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).

- Applies to: All entries

### Rule: Romanization, Japanese whitespace

Separate all words and particles with spaces. 

### Rule: Romanization, Chinese whitespace

For Chinese romaji, separate each character with a space.

Special names and proper nouns are kept together.

### Rule: Romanization, capitalization

Capitalize all words that are NOT single kana particles （は、が、を、etc）.

- E.g. *歌に形はないけれど* would be romanized as 'Uta ni Katachi wa Nai Keredo'.

### Rule: Romanization, no macrons for long vowels

Do not use macrons for long vowels. 

- *こおり* is romanized as 'koori', not 'kōri'.

### Rule: Romanization, apostrophe after ん

If ん is followed by a vowel (including や・ゆ・よ), romanize it as n'.
 
- E.g. *してやんよ* would be romanized as "Shiteyan'yo'"

### Rule: Romanization, は

は (ha) is romanized as 'wa' if it is used after a noun as a topic marker. 

- E.g. *恋は戦争* would be romanized as 'Koi wa Sensou', the は is not part of a word and functions as a particle.

### Rule: Romanization, づ

づ is romanized as 'dzu'.

### Rule: Romanization, を 

を (wo) is romanized as 'o' if it is used after a noun as a direct object particle. 

- E.g. *地球最後の告白を* would be romanized as 'Chikyuu Saigo no Kokuhaku o'

### Rule: Romanization, へ

へ (he) is romanized as 'e' if it is used after the name of a place to indicate direction as a particle. 

- E.g. *駆ける、星空の彼方へ* would be romanized as 'Kakeru, Hoshizora no Kanata e', the へ is not part of a word and functions as a particle.

### Rule: Romanization, identical name order

Use the same order as the original Japanese name. 

Usually this is "Lastname Firstname".

### Rule: Romanization, loanwords

Loanwords are romanized into their original language. 

- *コーヒー* would be romanized as 'coffee'. 

### Rule: Romanization, honorific suffix dash

Use a dash with honorific suffixes on names. 

- *お姉さん* would be romanized as 'Onee-san'

### Rule: Romanization, fully loanword names

If the entire name is composed of loanwords, leave the romanized name field empty. Use the translated name field instead.

Ai-assisted tools are not allowed for audio transcription, as they are extremely inaccurate with languages like Japanese and Chinese and even more so with Vocaloid.

## Rule: Separate artist personas

Respect artists' wishes to keep artist personas separate.

Elaborated on [this page](/docs/other-guidelines/merging-entries)

Composite names consisting of parts that are pronounced the same way in different writing systems should generally be avoided (with some exceptions).

Every field should contain only one version of the name:

- "Bumpyうるし(Urushi)" is incorrect → should be separated into two names: Bumpyうるし and BumpyUrushi

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Artist` entries

## Rule: Correct artist type

Artist type specifies the most common role that the artist participates in, with some overrides.

- Music producer overrides cover artist if they have at least one composed/arranged song entry. 
- Verified artists can request changing the chosen artist type.

The available artist roles are limited and serve as approximations. 
    - For example, the person responsible for the song image should be credited with the "illustrator" role, even if it's technically something else (e.g., photographer).

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Artist` entries

## Rule: Mention solo circle

If solo circle is added as an artist alias instead creating a separate entry, mention the circle alias in the artist entry description.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Artist` entries

## Rule: No circle name duplication

Do not unnecessarily duplicate (solo) circle names between the artist and the circle entry.

- Applies to: All `Artist` entries

Verified artists can request unlinking from the circle/group in any case.

- Applies to: All `Finished` `Artist` entries

## Rule: Label other voice synths

Engines for `Other voice synthesizer` (if available) need to be added as a tag and included in the voicebank entry name.

- If the voicebank has no separate engine, use the [voicebank-as-engine -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/10630/voicebank-as-engine). 
- If engine is not known, use the [unknown engine -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/7036). 
- Multiengine synths that have no clear or safe-to-assume base voicebanks usually have a corresponding "unknown"-entry. These are grouped under the ["unspecified voicebank engine"](https://vocadb.net/T/9027/unspecified-voicebank-engine) -tag.
