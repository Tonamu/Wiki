## Tab: Basic info

### Names

For general entry instructions regarding fields "Original language", "Primary name", "Non-English", "Romanized", "English", "Aliases":

- [Entry names and aliases](/docs/other-guidelines/entry-names-and-aliases)

#### Artist entry -specific name instructions

Real-life names should not be added as aliases, if they're not used by other artists/sources. Real-life names can still be added, if that's the main artist name.

It's common to see artists credited with additional [honorifics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics). These should not be added, unless the artist uses those themselves: [Gedou-san](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1823) for example.

If the artist name is not available, the [anonymous artist -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/6403/anonymous-artist) can be used along with some placeholder name.

Composite names consisting of parts that are pronounced the same way in different writing systems should generally be avoided (with some exceptions). Every field should contain only one version of the name:
- "Giga(ギガ)" is incorrect → should be separated into two names: Giga and ギガ
- "Bumpyうるし(Urushi)"" is incorrect → should be separated into two names: Bumpyうるし and BumpyUrushi

If there is no separate entry for the artist's **solo** circle, the circle name can be included as an alias. For these, the circle name should be mentioned in the artist description.

### Main picture

All pictures should be related to the artist, not their works.

Watch out for pictures that look like avatars but are actually part of the **default avatar collection** for the website. These should not be added. (TODO list of default avatars per site, piapro for example)

More on [Choosing the main picture for artist entries](/docs/artists/choosing-the-main-picture-for-artist-entries)

### Artist description

For other neutral and objective information that does not belong to any other field.

Subjective artist descriptions can be added with a blockquote along with the source:

```
From [source text](source url):
> I make music
```

Which displays as:

From [source text](https://example.com/):
> I make music


[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github) is supported for formatting.

English translation can be added/moved to a separate field below, if the original description exists in a non-English language.

### Artist type

Artist type specifies the **most common** role that the artist participates in. Additional roles can be specified with [tags](https://vocadb.net/T/7372/artists).

Be careful when changing the artist type, since it changes the default role for all of their existing entries.

Different artist types are described at [Artist types](/docs/artists/artist-types).

### Associated artists

These fields are available for voicebanks and are displayed when a suitable artist type is selected.

These are inherited to any derived voicebank and can be overwritten when necessary.

Multiple associated artists can be added with the same role (multiple illustrators for example).

#### Illustrator

- Illustrator of the official character/voicebank art.

#### Character designer

- Only needs to be specified if it's different from the illustrator.

#### Manager

- Manager of the character/voicebank.

- Only needs to be specified if it's different from the voice provider.

#### Voice provider

- Person who provided their voice for the voicebank.

### Groups and circles

For grouping related artists under a shared group/circle.

If an artist leaves a group/circle, generally it's best to mention this in the artist & circle description instead of emptying this field.

Solo circles can be added as artist aliases instead creating a separate entry (circle mentioned in the entry description).

### Base voicebank

Base voicebank if available.

For example, the base voicebank for [Megpoid Talk](https://vocadb.net/Ar/21629) is [GUMI](https://vocadb.net/Ar/3).

### Voicebank release date

The release date of the voicebank.
