This page explains what features VocaDB offers on artist entry pages.

Take Hatsune Miku for example: https://vocadb.net/Ar/1

This page displays the entry's data and provides several of VocaDB's features through user actions.

## Available user actions

[The artist entry status](/docs/artist-entry-editing#Status) is shown with an icon on this line.

### Follow

Artist entries can be _followed_ to show support and get notified when artists release new songs or albums or participate in events.

There are three artist-specific notification settings:

- No notifications.
- Notify me on-site.
- Notify me both on-site and by email.

Notifications are sent for new songs, albums and events where the followed artist participates (regardless if they include PVs or not). If the artist credit is added to the entry an hour after the entry was created, no notifications are sent.

If a new PV gets added to a song that had no PVs, and it happens after more than one week of the song entry creation date, notification messages are sent.

Follower lists for artists are not available, but followed artists for users are available at https://vocadb.net/Profile/{username}/artists

### Edit

The "Edit" button opens [the edit-page](/docs/artist-entry-editing#Artist-entry-editing) for the artist entry.

### View modifications

The "View modifications" button opens the version history for the artist entry:
https://vocadb.net/Artist/Versions/{artist_id}

The version history table uses 5 columns: _Version_, _Created_, _Author_, _Changes_, _Notes_.

The specific version can be viewed when clicking one of the version numbers in the "Version" column:

https://vocadb.net/Artist/ViewVersion/{version_id}

The version page has two user actions available (four for [moderators](/docs/user-groups)).

#### Revert to this version (moderators)

- Reverts the artist entry to this version. Used for countering vandalism and fixing edit mistakes.

#### Download XML

- Downloads the version information in [XML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

#### Report an error

- Reports the specific entry version. Using this, a notification will be sent to the relevant editor.

#### Hide this version (moderators)

- Hides the specific entry version. The version link will still be visible on the entry history page, but the link will be inaccessible to users that are not moderators.

### Report an error

Creates an [entry report](/docs/entry-reports) and adds it to the [entry report list](https://vocadb.net/Admin/ViewEntryReports) that is visible to trusted users+
