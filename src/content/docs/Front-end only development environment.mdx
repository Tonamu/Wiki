This guide is to start developing on vocaDB front-end only.
This bypasses the need to set up the back-end, run the server locally and set up a database.
By connecting to the VocaDB [beta website](https://beta.vocadb.net/) you are able to develop locally with minimal setup.
Do mind that if you have only recently created your account, it might not yet be available on the beta website and you will be unable to log in. Any other functionality should work as expected.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code
  - Extensions:
    - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
    - [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.18.3 (or latest LTS) with NPM.

## Step-by-step first setup

1. Ensure you have all the requirements installed.
2. Clone the repository and its submodules.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vocadb/vocadb.git --recurse-submodules
   cd vocadb
   ```

3. Open the VocaDB project in Visual Studio.
4. Prepare the vite configuration file. See [vite.config](#viteconfig) section for more information.
5. Build the frontend using Node.js. See [Compiling frontend assets](#compiling-frontend-assets) section for more information.

   1. Right click `VocaDbWeb` on the Solution Explorer in the right and select the <kbd>Open in Terminal</kbd> option.
   2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` on the Terminal.
   3. Build assets by running `npm run development` on the Terminal.

6. You should now be able to start developing.

## Formatting

Line endings and indentation are configured by [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/). There's a plugin for almost any major IDE/text editor. Please install that plugin before editing the code files.

For the frontend located on `VocaDbWeb`, Prettier and ESLint is used to ensure code quality. You can use plugins to enhance the use of them.

### Visual Studio Code

The following extensions are recommended in the `VocaDbWeb` folder.

  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) by [Dirk Baeumer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/dbaeumer)
  - [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) by [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/esbenp)

These configuration is recommended for better formatting on Visual Studio Code. Open the Settings screen (by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> and press <kbd>Preferences: Open Settings (UI)</kbd> or <kbd>File</kbd> (on the top left) > <kbd>Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Settings</kbd>) and change these settings.

- **Editor: Default Formatter**: <kbd>Prettier - Code formatter <small>esbenp.prettier-vscode</small></kbd>
- **Editor: Format on Save**: *checked*

## vite.config

Navigate to `VocaDbWeb\vite.config.ts`. Here you will see a configuration file that currently points to `'https://localhost:5001'` in two locations locations. Replace the value with `'https://beta.vocadb.net'` to connect to the VocaDB beta server.

## Compiling frontend assets

Ensure Node.js is installed and `VocaDbWeb` is opened on the Terminal of Visual Studio Code before running these commands.

Install the frontend dependencies by running this command.

```bash
npm install
```

Run this command so that Vite will automatically recompile your assets when it detects a change.

```bash
npm run development
```
