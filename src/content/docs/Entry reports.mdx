Entry reports are a way of keeping track and communicating various issues to moderators and relevant editors. 

[The list of entry reports](https://vocadb.net/Admin/ViewEntryReports) is visible to [trusted users](/docs/documentation/user-groups) and above.

- Trusted users should **ignore moderation-related reports** such as [artist verification](/docs/artists/artist-verification) and [content removal](/docs/other-guidelines/content-removal-guidelines) requests. These are handled by moderators and above.

Entry reports can be sent anonymously â€“ a user account is not required.

Reporting an entry sends a notification to the original editor. If the entry has been edited by **more than one person**, notifications are **not sent**.

For entries edited by multiple users, a **specific entry version** should be reported instead: 
- Click ["View Modifications"](/docs/songs/song-entry-page#view-modifications).
- Locate the version where the error was first present.
- Click "Report an Error". 

Always include **relevant evidence** in your report when appropriate. For example, unless plainly obvious, evidence should always be provided when reporting duplicate entries.  

When reporting mistakes, it's recommended to provide **relevant context** by linking to the wiki. This is helpful to everyone involved, and helps the relevant editor more clearly identify and learn from their mistake

## Goals of entry reports

Entry reports can have multiple goals:
- 1) **Tracking** issues that should be fixed.
- 2) **Educating** the original editor about the mistake.
- 3) **Alerting** moderators about various issues.

If **none** of these goals are relevant, an entry report **should not be sent**.

### Goal: Tracking

Entry reports can be used to **track issues** that should be fixed.

If an entry with mistakes is already **tracked somewhere else** (with [tags](/docs/secondary-entry-types/tags#editor-notes) for example), the entry report is probably redundant.

### Goal: Educating

It's preferable that edit mistakes are fixed by the editor who made them for:
- 1) Fairness, "picking up after yourself"
- 2) More effective rule **learning**

After an entry report has been sent, it's recommended that you wait **at least 24 hours** before fixing the report. Trusted users should not handle the entry report before this if there is a **possibility** that the original editor will fix the issue and **learn** from it.

### Goal: Alerting

Entry reports can also be used to send **alerts** to moderators.

 For urgent cases (vandalism, spamming, etc.), it's recommended to also/instead ping "@VocaDB moderator" on the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/3bwXQNXKCz).

## Entry report types

Using the correct entry report type is helpful. 

Albums and artist entries have five report types, while songs have an additional "Broken PV" type.

Entry reports sent for a **specific entry version** automatically use the "Other" report type.

### Broken PV (for songs)

For reporting deleted or privated PVs.

[Region blocked](https://vocadb.net/T/8226) PVs should not be reported as broken PVs.

### Invalid or missing information

For reporting invalid or missing information in the entry. For example:
- Incorrect artist credits
- Romanizations/translations that do not follow the [Romanization Guidelines](/docs/other-guidelines/romanization-guidelines)

### Invalid tag usage

For entries that include incorrect tags. Remember to clarify the incorrect tags with the report.

### Duplicate entry

For duplicate entries that should be [merged](/docs/other-guidelines/merging-entries). A link to the duplicate entry is **required**, along with proof.

Note that artist entries **should not be automatically merged**, even if it can be proven that they are the [same person/individual](/docs/other-guidelines/merging-entries#splitting-artist-entries). The situation needs to be discussed first.

### Inappropriate content

For entries [against the content policy](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy) that do not belong in VocaDB.

### Other (specify in notes)

For errors not already covered by the other report types.

## Unacceptable entry reports

### Questions

**Do not use entry reports for questions or discussions**. Use the entry comments, [discussions](https://vocadb.net/discussion), or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3bwXQNXKCz) for these purposes. 

### Requests to add new albums/songs 

VocaDB is a volunteer-based collaboration project. The editor who created the artist entry is not responsible for keeping the artist discography up-to-date if/when new songs and albums get published. 

If you don't want to wait, it's best to make an account and add the new entries yourself.  

### Improvement requests on existing entries

Entries that fulfill the [finished entry criteria](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#finished-song-entry-requirements) should not be reported to request additional information in most cases.

Lyric requests, for example should be made with the [lyric transcript needed](https://vocadb.net/T/6362/lyric-transcript-needed) tag.

**Do not request tagging** on entries unless they are approved or locked.

### Multiple entry reports of the same type

Spamming multiple similar reports is distracting and unproductive. Instead, consider one of the following options:
- A) List and mention the other entries within one report.
- B) Mention the other entries under the reported entry as a comment.
- C) Message a moderator with a list of entries.

## Handling entry reports

Invalid entry reports can be safely closed. Asking for proof and further clarifications under the reported entry is **recommended, but optional**.

### Handling Broken PV reports

Entries tagged with [region blocked](https://vocadb.net/T/8226) should be ignored and its associated report closed.

- *Original* PVs should be marked as *Unavailable*.
- If the PV type is *Reprint* or *Other*, the link should be deleted. 

### Handling Invalid or missing information reports

If the report is valid (and 24 hours have passed), the issue can be simply fixed.

For reports requiring further investigation (e.g., hard-to-verify album information), move the discussion to the entry's comment section.

### Handling Duplicate entry reports

Simple song entry duplicates can be merged.

Leave complex duplicate artist reports to moderators.

### Handling Inappropriate content reports

If the report is invalid (common with [cover unifier entries](https://vocadb.net/T/6751/out-of-scope-cover-unifier)), the content policy should be linked/explained in the comment section.

If the report is valid, it's a good idea to also leave a comment under the deleted entry to notify the entry creator.

### Handling content removal requests (mods)

If the [content removal request](/docs/other-guidelines/content-removal-guidelines) does not fulfill the necessary requirements, the entry report should be closed. 

If the report came from a user account, a message should be sent. Otherwise a message should be left under the reported entry.

### Handling artist verification request (mods)

If the proof is insufficient, close the report and send a message to the user.
