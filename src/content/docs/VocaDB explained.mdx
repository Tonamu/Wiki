VocaDB is a structured *database* for organizing voice synth music.

VocaDB supports advanced and efficient search queries, and is pluggable into [other websites and services through the API](/docs/services-that-make-use-of-vocadb-apis). 

[Songs](/docs/songs), [Artists](/docs/artists) and [Albums](/docs/albums) are considered as the "main" entry types.

The "secondary" entry types are [Song lists](/docs/song-lists), [Tags](/docs/tags), [Events](/docs/events), [Event Series](/docs/event-series) & [Venues](/docs/venues)

Site features such as user accounts and discussion topics are also "entry types" in a *technical sense*.

A more complete entry type relationship is visualized below:

![Entry type graph](public/images/entry_type_graph.png "Entry type graph")

Before creating entries, make sure that they [belong to the database](/docs/content-policy).

[Content removal guidelines](/docs/content-removal-guidelines) describe our general policy for removing entries and information.

If you spot mistakes on entries, you can leave an [entry report](/docs/entry-reports) or try fixing the issue on your own.
