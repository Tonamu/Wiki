VocaDB is a structured *database* for organizing voice synth music.

VocaDB supports advanced and efficient search queries, and is pluggable into [other websites and services through the API](http://localhost:4321/docs/documentation/services-that-make-use-of-vocadb-apis). 

[Songs](/docs/songs), [Artists](/docs/artists) and [Albums](/docs/albums) are considered as the "main" [entry types](/docs/other-guidelines/entry-types).

A more complete entry type relationship is visualized below:
