VocaDB is a structured *database* for organizing voice synth music.

VocaDB supports advanced and efficient search queries, and is pluggable into [other websites and services through the API](http://localhost:4321/docs/services-that-make-use-of-vocadb-apis). 

[Songs](/docs/songs), [Artists](/docs/artists) and [Albums](/docs/albums) are considered as the "main" entry types.

The "secondary" entry types are [Song lists](/docs/song-lists), [Tags](/docs/tags), [Events](/docs/events), [Event Series](/docs/event-series) & [Venues](/docs/venues)

Site features such as user accounts and discussion topics are also "entry types" in a *technical sense*.

A more complete entry type relationship is visualized below:
