## What is it?

Utaite music database collects information about original and arranged versions of Utaite-related discography, including translated information about artists, songs and albums.

The website allows you to keep track of albums you own and songs that you like. Follow artists to get notifications when new music is added by those artists. Genres can be followed as well. Bidirectional linking makes it possible to find all related versions of a particular song. Titles can be displayed in one of the 3 language options: original (Japanese), Romanized or English.

## Why?

Because no other website exists with this feature set.

## What is allowed?

Any songs and albums based on music from Utaite artists.
