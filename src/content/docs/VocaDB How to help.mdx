VocaDB is fully a volunteer-based organization. If you're interested in contributing in various ways, please read ahead.

## General ways to help

### Editing entries

VocaDB aims to be the most accurate and complete source of voice synth content (albums, artists, songs, etc.). You can help with this by adding new and/or improving the existing entries.

It's helpful to also send [entry reports](/docs/pinned/entry-reports) when noticing errors. Anyone can remind and educate other editors about the guidelines, as long as the tone of the message or the comment is diplomatic and appropriate.

Some shared *entry lists* have also been made that focus on certain tasks: -upcoming- 

### Improving rules and guidelines

Our guidelines and rules sharpen and evolve as edge cases emerge and new trends appear.

Guideline discussion and debate is currently mostly limited to a non-public [discord](https://discord.com/invite/3bwXQNXKCz) channel (#mods-and-trusted), but thoughtful guideline suggestions and clarification requests are always welcome.

The wiki content (including this text) is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/VocaDB/Wiki), which accepts change proposals through [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Rule and guideline changes should always be discussed first, but PRs that fix typos or clarify sentences for example are always accepted and quickly merged.

### Promoting the website

As a collaborative project, we benefit from having a large and diverse userbase.

VocaDB api enables the development of [external services](/docs/documentation/services-that-make-use-of-vocadb-apis).

## If you're a programmer (C#, ASP.NET Core, TypeScript, React)

See the instructions in [the README](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb#readme).

For fixing bugs and implementing feature requests, fork and create a pull request to the main repository. Participating in a non-public [discord](https://discord.com/invite/3bwXQNXKCz) channel (#dev-talk) is recommended.

## If you're a programmer (Mobile, Dart)

VocaDB also exists as a native Android + Apple mobile app, created by [up2code](https://vocadb.net/Profile/up2up). The app code repository can be found on [GitHub/VocaDB/VocaDB-App](https://github.com/VocaDB/VocaDB-App).

## If you're a programmer (any language)

GitHub issues labeled with [external solution possible](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22external+solution+possible%22) can be implemented or workaround-ed in some form with any language.

If you manage to create/find a working solution or workaround for these issues, please mention it on the relevant github issue.

The public [#api-projects](https://discord.com/channels/309072240639737866/1039922389301072014) -channel can be used as a relevant discussion area.

## If you know non-English languages

We need people who know specific languages, especially Japanese and Chinese.

Please update your "known languages" in your [profile settings](https://vocadb.net/User/MySettings) and let us know if we can contact you if/when help is needed.

The relevant discussion area for translation-related topics is [#translate -channel](https://discord.com/channels/309072240639737866/808128811056889886) on Discord.

Website translations are managed through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/vocadb), a localization management platform.

Translations for the VocaDB wiki pages are also welcome. These are currently implemented as separate wiki pages. 

## Donations

VocaDB is free to use for everyone and does not display any sort of ads. However, running a website is not free. VocaDB, UtaiteDB and TouhouDB are running on servers that need to be paid monthly. 

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vocadb) is our main source of funding.

Additionally, if you want to donate to the [VocaDB-App](https://github.com/VocaDB/VocaDB-App) hosted by [up2code](https://vocadb.net/Profile/up2up), please visit the dedicated [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/up2up039).

## Other

For any improvement ideas or feature requests for the website, please first search through [the issue tracker](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/issues) before creating a new issue (="ticket"). High-quality proposals are especially appreciated. Voting and commenting on the existing proposals can be helpful as well. 

Our community is mostly gathered up in our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/3bwXQNXKCz). We try to maintain a mature and friendly atmosphere.
