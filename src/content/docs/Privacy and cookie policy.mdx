VocaDB will never share personal information with 3rd parties. We will do our best to make sure that the database containing user information will be kept secure.

## Cookies
VocaDB uses cookies to store user session. Thus, cookies are required for using functions for registered users. Cookies are also used to store the content language selection. 

Without cookies, all content will be displayed in default language and users are not able to log in.

## Privacy policy
VocaDB stores user's email address. This email address will be used for messages such as password resets and content notifications. Content notifications are always opt-in. In normal situations, VocaDB will never send email to users without the user requesting to be contacted.

User's IP address is stored and matched against IP addresses of known spammers. This is essential to prevent abuse of the website.

User IDs and hashed IPs (if no user) are stored for viewed album and song entries for statistical purposes (page hit counts).

Passwords are stored in the database in a secured format (HMAC-SHA1). Theoretically it should be impossible to decipher the original password.

## Artists' private information

Sometimes artist's private information, such as their real name or picture, ends up in their artist profiles. Because all information is versioned, the historical versions cannot be deleted by normal users.

If you are the artist in question and you're worried about your personal information, currently we offer the following options:

* Deleting the relevant pieces of information from the current live version. This is the most preferred option. If necessary, the old versions can also be hidden.
* Soft-deleting your artist profile, hiding it from all listings. This operation is reversible, but the artist profile is still accessible with direct URL, even though there are no links.
* Hard-deleting your artist profile. This operation is permanent and will remove your profile from all listings, and also direct URL.

We are looking into options to selectively delete individual pieces of information, such as just the picture, but currently this is not possible.

## GDPR

VocaDB database is stored in EU. Therefore, users of VocaDB have the right to ask for listing of their personal information, and asking it to be removed from the database. This includes 

* User's account
* Personal identifiable information on artist profiles, such as real name and picture

If you wish to invoke your right to delete your personal information from VocaDB, send us a message with proof that you are the person in question, and we will permanently remove your information. Please understand that this operation is by definition permanent, and information deleted this way cannot be restored.
