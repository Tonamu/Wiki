![Entry type graph](public/images/entry_type_graph.png "Entry type graph")

[Songs](/docs/songs), [Artists](/docs/artists) and [Albums](/docs/albums) are considered as the "main" entry types.

The secondary entry types are:
- [Songlists](/docs/secondary-entry-types/song-lists)
- [Tags](/docs/secondary-entry-types/tags)
- [Events](/docs/secondary-entry-types/events)
- [Event Series] ðŸš§
- [Venues] ðŸš§

Site features such as user accounts and discussion topics are also "entry types" in a technical sense.

Next: [Songlists](/docs/secondary-entry-types/song-lists).
