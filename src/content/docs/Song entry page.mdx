This page explains the fields and features for the song entry page.

_Rollin' Girl by wowaka_ for example: https://vocadb.net/S/1501

## Available user actions

[The song entry status](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#Status) is shown with an icon on this line.

### Like

Rating a song adds it to your song collection (rated songs): https://vocadb.net/Profile/{username}/songs

The song entry page statistics for "favorite(s) and like(s)" will include your username, unless the "Allow everyone to see my song and album ratings." setting is disabled. All of the ratings will stay visible for moderators, and for anyone who visits your rated songs through your profile page.

_Liking_ a song increases its score by 2.

### Favorite

_Favoriting_ a song increases its score by 3.

### Add to custom list

The song can be added to a new or existing song list with this button.

#### Personal lists

All of the custom lists by the user are displayed: https://vocadb.net/Profile/{username}/lists

The "description" field refers to the song list song notes, not the song list description.

#### Featured

Trusted users can add new songs to the [featured songlists](https://vocadb.net/SongList/Featured?categoryName=Pools)

#### New list

### View modifications

The "View modifications" -button opens the version history for the song entry:
https://vocadb.net/Song/Versions/{artist_id}

The version history table uses 5 columns: _Version_, _Created_, _Author_, _Changes_, _Notes_.

The specific version can be viewed when clicking one of the version numbers in the Version-column:
