[Albums](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing#Release-event) and [songs](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#Release-event) can be connected to a release event. This connection indicates that the album or song was released **during** or **for** that event. For physical events this generally means that the album was first distributed at that event, so the release event date matches album release date.

Examples of events include **physical events** such as [The Voc@loid M@ster](https://vocadb.net/Es/1) and [Comiket](https://vocadb.net/Es/3), and **virtual events** such as [APOLLO](https://vocadb.net/Es/30) and the character birthdays.

For virtual events it's possible that the release date doesn't match exactly with the event date, but usually it's close. For example, for character birthdays the albums might be released a week ahead. In this case it's still **acceptable** to connect the album or song to the release event, as long as the artist or publisher **officially states** that the album or song was released for that event.

In case of an album song, connecting both the album and song to the same event is generally **redundant** and should be avoided.

When adding an event to a song or album, you can select an existing event, or create a new event from the entry edit page. In case of a new event, the system tries to make an **intelligent guess** regarding the event series. If no series is found, the event is created as a standalone event, which can later be connected to a series if needed. Whenever **creating a new event from the entry edit page**, please make sure that the **series is selected correctly**.

Events can be [tagged](/docs/secondary-entry-types/tags) and event participants can be credited through [artist entries](/docs/artists/artist-entry-page).

## Event categories

- **Album release fair** (AKA. doujin fair): For conventions with the primary intention of selling albums. This includes Comiket, The Voc@loid M@ster and M3.
- **Character anniversary**: Character birthdays (release dates).
- **Club**: DJ party events.

- **Other**: Events that do not fit into any of the categories above.

## Event setlists

A setlist can be created by connecting a song list to an event entry. Most of the information about the concert should go to the event entry, with the song list only containing the list of songs.

Generally the original version should be preferred for the setlist, regardless of any [live recording -entries](https://vocadb.net/T/240/live-recording).
