This page documents the most fequently asked questions and edit mistakes regarding VocaDB entries.

## Albums

<RuleEmbed ruleId={54} />

### Should I create an album entry for a single song?

If there is clear indication that the song was released as a single, then yes, you can use the ["Single" album type](/docs/docs/album-entry-editing#single).

## Voicebanks

### Should voice synth characters with multiple voicebanks be split into multiple entries?

As a general guideline, voice synth entries should correspond to the voicebanks available in the corresponding editor.

If the voicebanks were distributed separately, that's also a strong reason for splitting the voicebanks into different entries.

Appends/variations such as [Miku V4X Dark](http://vocadb.net/Ar/50233) and [Miku V4X Solid](http://vocadb.net/Ar/50235) are separate entries. However, [EVEC](http://vocadb.net/T/4828/evec) voice colors such as Miku V4X Soft EVEC are not separate entries, because they're not considered separate voicebanks. Instead, voice colors are tracked by tags when necessary.

Sometimes a voice synth might have multiple voicebanks, but they're almost always credited as a single entity. For example, [ONE](http://vocadb.net/Ar/31062) has both talking and singing voicebanks. In such cases, to simplify the crediting process, only one entry on VocaDB is necessary. If needed, that single voicebank entry can be split later.

When in doubt, the safest approach is to start with a single entry and split it later if required. This helps avoid creating multiple unused Vocaloid entries.

### Reasons for splitting voicebank entries

- Voicebanks are commonly credited as separate by the artists
- Voicebanks appear separate in the editor
- Voicebanks sound distinctly different, or are made for different languages
- Voicebanks have separate brand names / box art
- Voicebanks were released at different times
- Voicebanks can be purchased separately (they are not always bundled together)

Rationale: Artist entries don't generally interfere with each other, but having an excessive amount of them makes finding and managing each individual entry difficult. We want the voicebank credits to be as accurate as possible, but without needlessly complicating editing. Helping users find relevant information is key, so we try to strike a balance.
