Song entries are pages for individual songs. These entries include song-related metadata (as *fields*) such as title, song duration, media embeds/links and *connections* to other entry types such as artists.

These *connections* are in most cases one-way:
- Song entries "include" artist entries.
- Album entries "include" song entries.

A new connection with an artist and a song entry needs to be made by editing the song entry. 

A full list of song-related rules is available [here](/rules/songs)
