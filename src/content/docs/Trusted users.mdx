A Trusted user is someone who has been given access to full editing functionality on VocaDB.

In addition to regular user features, trusted users have access to the following:
* [Deleting entries](/docs/content-removal-guidelines) (not just the ones they created)
* [Merging entries](/docs/merging-entries)
* Approving entries (and editing them)
* Removing tags from entries
* Creating and editing "[featured song lists](https://vocadb.net/SongList/Featured)"
* Managing [entry reports](/docs/entry-reports)
* Limiting user accounts (removing editing permissions)

## Things to remember

We expect you to know the basic guidelines on VocaDB, and most importantly, ask the other members if you're unsure of something.

Here are some things to keep in mind:
* Trusted users are not moderators. Skip moderation-related entry reports such as [artist verification](/docs/artist-verification) and [content removal](/docs/content-removal-guidelines) requests.
* Before [merging entries](/docs/merging-entries), keep in mind that undoing a merge, especially merging artist entries, can be a lot of work, so please make sure the entries really need to be merged.
* Being a trusted user doesn't mean that you're above others. Please try to listen to advice given by other members, especially those who have been on the site longer than you.
* Avoid assuming things without proof or reference. VocaDB is intended to be a reliable source of information. When working on a database/encyclopedia it's better to be safe than sorry. If you have to assume, at least make it clear that there is no reference.
* Avoid fights or personal insults in the public entry comment sections. Personal arguments are to be resolved elsewhere. AKA no drama.
* Communicate! If you're unsure, post a question in the comments. If you find something to be improved, or disagree with our rules, post your opinion in the comments (but avoid unnecessary, pointless arguing). Note that ignoring others, (especially staff members), doesn't work in the long run. If you're being harassed, message a staff member.
* The [entry reports](https://vocadb.net/Admin/ViewEntryReports) page is for reports themselves; they are **NOT just notifications**. The exclaimation point and number under the "Account" menu are there to let you know that there are active reports that need to be addressed. If you dislike this feature, you may use the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/) extension and install [this script](https://userstyles.world/style/19593/hide-vdb-notifs) by Shiroizu. **Do not close them** unless they have been fixed or otherwise addressed. 
* The limiting permissions that trusted users have are intended as a way to quickly respond to major issues such as spam or vandalism if no moderators or admins are available. Besides those cases, trusted users should generally not use the limiting permission.

## How to become trusted user?

There are no specific criteria for becoming a trusted user. It is based on time spent on the website, quantity, and (especially) quality of edits. A small number of detailed edits can qualify a user for promotion. Communication also matters; we expect trusted users to be respectful, avoid arguments with other users, and ask someone senior if they're unsure of something. This also means taking responsibility for correcting any mistakes with your edits when someone points them out.

Please don't ask us to promote you to trusted. Eventually a staff member (moderator or administrator) will notice your edits, make a short review and promote you if they're satisfied. If they're unsure, they will contact you and/or other staff members first.
